        <h1>Who I Am - Alan walker</h1>
        <p>Don't say this, don't say that</p>
        <p>I'm not playing by the rules if they were made by you</p>
        <p>I won't break just like that</p>
        <p>I'll make my own mistakes 'til I'm wrong in all the right ways</p>
        <p>Save all your tears</p>
        <p>You don't wanna waste them on me</p>
        <p>I'm not gonna be just like them</p>
        <p>This is just the way that I am</p>
        <p>Head in the clouds</p>
        <p>I do not fit in to the crowd</p>
        <p>Baby, it's all making perfect sense</p>
        <p>'Cause this is who I am</p>
        <p>Who I am</p>
        <p>If only I was wide awake</p>
        <p>There's more than I can take</p>
        <p>And when you dive into the blue</p>
        <p>I'll be right next to you</p>
        <p>I never wanna miss a thing</p>
        <p>We fall in love again</p>
        <p>You know I may hold on to June</p>
        <p>'Cause all that you go through, I'm with you</p>
        <p>'Cause all that you go through, I'm-</p>
        <p>'Cause all that you go through, I'm with you</p>
